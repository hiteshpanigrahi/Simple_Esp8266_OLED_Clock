# Simple_Esp8266_OLED_Clock ‚è∞

A compact and stylish real-time clock project built using the **ESP8266 NodeMCU**, an **OLED display**, and **NTP (Network Time Protocol)** for precise timekeeping. This project is perfect for showcasing your electronics and IoT skills while keeping track of time in style!

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Real-Time Clock**: Fetches accurate time from an NTP server.
- **Indian Standard Time (IST)**: Adjusts for UTC +5:30.
- **Compact Design**: Built on a perforated PCB for a clean and organized look.
- **OLED Display**: Displays time (HH:MM:SS), date, day, and AM/PM.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Syncs time using a Wi-Fi network.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Components
- **ESP8266 NodeMCU**: The brain of the project, handling Wi-Fi and NTP functions.
- **0.96" OLED Display**: For displaying the time, date, and day.
- **Perforated PCB**: For organizing components neatly.
- **5V Power Supply Module**: Powers the NodeMCU and OLED display.
- **Jumper Wires**: For all the connections.

## üîå Wiring Diagram
| OLED Pin  | ESP8266 Pin |
|-----------|-------------|
| GND       | GND         |
| VCC       | 3V3         |
| SCL       | D1 (GPIO5)  |
| SDA       | D2 (GPIO4)  |

## üöÄ How It Works
1. Connect the ESP8266 NodeMCU to Wi-Fi using your credentials.
2. Sync time from the **NTP server**.
3. Adjust the time to Indian Standard Time (UTC +5:30).
4. Display the **time, date, day**, and **AM/PM** status on the OLED.
